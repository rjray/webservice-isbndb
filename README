WebService::ISBNDB - Access to the isbndb.com API

Version: 0.34

WHAT IS IT

This is a module to provide programmatic access to the database of book and
author information hosted by isbndb.com (see http://isbndb.com). To access
the API provided by the site, you will have to register a user account and
create an access key.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
	./Build test

If WebService::ISBNDB passes all tests, then:

        ./Build install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

Fixed/updated copyright and licensing information. All licensing links
are current with regards to Artistic 2.0 and LGPL 2.1.

Fixed a bug found by Gavin Carr in which search attempts routed through
static-method invocations of search() in any of the types (Books,
Authors, etc.) would fail to get the API key unless one had been set as
a default.

Fixed $VERSION strings to bump them up; bitten by svn oversight again.

Added the warnings pragma for cleanliness and consistency (despite this
being a dummy module).
