WebService::ISBNDB - Access to the isbndb.com API

Version: 0.32

WHAT IS IT

This is a module to provide programmatic access to the database of book and
author information hosted by isbndb.com (see http://isbndb.com). To access
the API provided by the site, you will have to register a user account and
create an access key.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
	./Build test

If WebService::ISBNDB passes all tests, then:

        ./Build install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

lib/WebService/ISBNDB/API.pm:
Fixed a bug reported by Kevin Old in which trying to "find" an item
using a handle with a non-default API key, and the factory syntax,
would fail to use the existing API key.
