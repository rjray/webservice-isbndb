WebService::ISBNDB - Access to the isbndb.com API

Version: 0.31

WHAT IS IT

This is a module to provide programmatic access to the database of book and
author information hosted by isbndb.com (see http://isbndb.com). To access
the API provided by the site, you will have to register a user account and
create an access key.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
	./Build test

If WebService::ISBNDB passes all tests, then:

        ./Build install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

Build.PL:
lib/WebService/ISBNDB.pm:
t/00_load.t:
Added a WebService::ISBNDB module. This is an empty module that acts
as the version place-holder, both for build numbering and for testing
by modules that depend on this package.

lib/WebService/ISBNDB/API.pm:
t/05_api_baseclass.t:
Found that creating an API object with an explicit API key argument was
ignoring the user argument and using the default all the time. Also
created test cases to check this going forward.

lib/WebService/ISBNDB/API/Books.pm:
t/50_books.t:
t/Books-book_id=programming_web_services_with_perl.xml:
Fixed a bug in which looking up a book (via find()) with the ID instead
of the ISBN did not work. Added a unit test for this, as well.
